Project workflow :

The application starts with index.html which is the login page. The traveller enters his firstname, lastname, pnr number
and frequent flyer number(if exists) and logins into the application.
In the main page, there are four different sections i.e. order food, destination, kids section and news in which we have
implemented the first three sections.

1. Order food: It displays the foodcourts present in the airport stored in the database from which he can order the food.
               If he is a frequent flyer, miles can redeemed to pay for the order but the payment gateway is not yet integrated.

2. Kids Section: It includes a game "TIC-TAC-TOE" which is fun to play.

3. Destination: This section covers the information about the destination such as climate, hotels, events, famous eateries,
                night life, activities, Government tourism but they are not yet implemented.

4. News: This section will get redirected to a news website.
